Warp-Inspired Terminal Enhancer
Welcome to the Warp-Inspired Terminal Enhancer! This open-source project brings innovative features inspired by Warp to your existing terminal, leveraging Python for scripting, automation, and AI-powered enhancements.

Unlike Warp, which is a full terminal emulator built in Rust, this project focuses on enhancing your current terminal (e.g., Alacritty, Kitty, or your system’s default terminal) with Python-driven tools like AI command suggestions and reusable workflows. Python’s strengths in scripting and AI make it an accessible choice for rapid development and community contributions.

🚀 Features
AI-Powered Command Suggestions
Get smart command completions and suggestions powered by natural language processing (NLP). The tool analyzes your input and history to propose relevant commands.
Reusable Workflows
Automate repetitive tasks with customizable Python scripts. Save, share, and run workflows to streamline your workflow.
Collaboration Tools
Share workflows or suggestions with others. (Planned feature—help us build it!)
Cross-Platform Compatibility
Works seamlessly on macOS, Linux, and Windows thanks to Python’s portability.
🐍 Why Python?
Python excels in scripting, automation, and AI, making it perfect for the features we’re building. However, due to performance limitations, it’s not ideal for a full terminal emulator. Instead, this project enhances your existing terminal with Python-powered tools, offering a practical and extensible way to improve your command-line experience.
